Its pretty simple, it will generate a links.txt file for you, put links in there seperated by a new line
like
this

Make sure you dont have an extra line, or else you may get an error

Where you can find the videos once they are done installing is in a folder located in the same directory as the .py file, titled "downloads"

As of version 1.0.2, it will attempt to automatically install pytube if it cannot import it, make sure to have pip working to use this feature.

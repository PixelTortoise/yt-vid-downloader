Its pretty simple, it will generate a links.txt file for you, put links in there seperated by a new line
like
this

Make sure you dont have an extra line, or else you may get an error

Where you can find the videos once they are done installing is in a folder located in the same directory as the .py file, titled "downloads"
Currently it only supports .mp4 files, I am currently working on making it support .mp3 files too.

This also uses the pytube module, it will say if it cannot import pytube.

DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible for any redistributing of copyrighted material, this is not intended for redistributing or piriating copyrighted content, it is simply for personal, non commercial use, and must be used strictly to download videos that are ok with it.

Its pretty simple, it will generate a links.txt file for you, put links in there seperated by a new line
like
this

Make sure you dont have an extra line, or else you may get an error

Where you can find the videos once they are done installing is in a folder located in the same directory as the .py file, titled "downloads"

This also uses the pytube module, it will say if it cannot import pytube.

# Yt Vid Downloader

DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible for any redistributing of copyrighted material, this is not intended for redistributing or piriating copyrighted content, it is simply for personal, non commercial use, and must be used strictly to download videos that are ok with it.

This is a super simple youtube video downloader that downloads videos in .mp3 or .mp4 format, more features coming soon (I'm thinking of adding playlist support to download an entire playlist)

# How to use

Run the .py or .exe file, it will generate a links.txt, you put the filetype video links, playlist links that you want to download, and if it downloads the descriptions or not the format of the file is below

(file format, either mp3 or mp4)

download_description=(true or false)

links

links

links

add as many links as you want

After running it will attempt to download everything, and when its done, it will say done

Since I compiled it using py2exe (https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe), no python or pytube installation is required if you are using the .exe

Special thanks to:

Auto py to exe: https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe

Pytube: https://pypi.org/project/pytube/

# Troubleshooting

Exe only works for Windows operating systems I beleive, it may work for Macs, but I don't know.
If you can't get the exe to work install pytube from the command line, and make sure you have python installed, then run the python file in the latest release, not the exe

The exe does not need any installation of python, or pytube, as it is compiled, not interpreted, also if you have an antivirus, it may scream at you for running the exe, just let it run, and if you are afraid of malicious code being used, download the .py and look at it for yourselves

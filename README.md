# Yt Vid Downloader

DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible for any redistributing of copyrighted material, this is not intended for redistributing or piriating copyrighted content, it is simply for personal, non commercial use, and must be used strictly to download videos that are ok with it.

This is a super simple youtube video downloader that downloads videos in .mp3 or .mp4 format, more features coming soon (I'm thinking of adding playlist support to download an entire playlist)

# How to use

Run the .py or .exe file, it will generate a links.txt, you put the filetype and video links that you want to download, the format of the file is below

(file format, either mp3 or mp4)
links
links
links
add as many links as you want

After running it will let you know if things went smoothly, and if it did then all the videos should showup in the newly generated "output" folder

Since I compiled it using py2exe (https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe), in theory it should not require any module installation, or even python installation

# Special thanks

Special thanks to:

Auto py to exe: https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe

Pytube: https://pypi.org/project/pytube/

# Troubleshooting

Exe only works for Windows operating systems I beleive, it may work for Macs, but I don't know.
If you can't get the exe to work install pytube from the command line, and make sure you have python installed, then run the python file in the latest release, not the exe

The exe does not need any installation of python, or pytube, as it is compiled, not interpreted
